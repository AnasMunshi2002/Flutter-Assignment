24. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism.

    Inheritance
    - Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) derives attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class).
    - It promotes code re usability by allowing a subclass to inherit the properties and behavior of its superclass.

    Polymorphism
    - Polymorphism is combination of words 'poly' and 'morphs' which collectively means many forms.
    - Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.
    - It allows for flexibility and extensibility in the code by enabling objects to be treated as instances of their superclass, even when they are actually instances of subclasses.
