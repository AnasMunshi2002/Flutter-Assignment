// 42. Can a subclass instance method override a superclass static method?

- In Dart, a subclass instance method cannot override a superclass static method.
- Instead of overriding, it hides the static method in the superclass.
- This means that the static method in the superclass is not accessible through the subclass instances, but it can still be accessed using the superclass name.
